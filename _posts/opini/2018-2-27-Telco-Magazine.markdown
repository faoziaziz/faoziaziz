In my lovely departement on ITB, Telecommunication Engineering. Maybe, there better to make a magazine to promote this departement. Not only in Telecommunication Engineering but also to fullfil our duty as an Bachelor as iron stock, agent of change and guardian of value. Writting not only make some people to read, but also construct his future with what his/her readed. As Derrida saying in *The Act of Literature*, thats the text has otonimic power to build the reader paradigm. 

*Verklaren* or interpretation in The Question of Concering in Technology will teach us that write is the part of understanding or *Verstehen*. Write a magazine that conclude what we got from Telco Education, will increase our consideration about telco it self, so it will be good for us to learn and promote our departement to Indonesia, or to the world. Maybe many project in our cours can be contained in this magazine. 

If we want to be bussinesman, we can use this magazine also for to founding rissing. We can make the coloumn in our magazine to be advertised. And we also publish our agenda in this magazine so alumni or boundary instantion who want to help this agenda can get access better from this magazine, and also they can monitor what we do in our departement. 

This magazine can also make our solidarity to be better. There are many bachelor student in our departement has many bussines in their live, with this magazine the hope many hobbies will taked by this magazine, for example chess tournament agenda, or tennis agenda in our departement. Or maybe make poetry to modus a senorita.
